1. **Compounding in investments** - Several comments mention appreciation for your insights, with one specifically mentioning "the sip of compounding," suggesting your audience is interested in investment growth strategies.

2. **Personal development journey** - Comments like "Need to learn many things from you bro, especially positivity" indicate viewers appreciate your personal development content and mindset advice.

3. **Time management and efficiency** - Based on the comment about "taking a lot of time to learn and do things in life," your audience might benefit from content about optimizing learning processes and productivity.

4. **Beginner-friendly investment guides** - Comments suggesting viewers want to "be like you one day" indicate you have viewers who look up to your expertise and want to follow a similar path.

5. **Mindset and positivity** - This was explicitly mentioned as something viewers want to learn from you.

It's worth noting that these suggestions are limited by the small sample of comments provided. For more comprehensive topic recommendations, I would need access to more extensive comment data, video performance metrics, and audience demographics. A broader analysis of your channel analytics would help identify content gaps and viewer interests more accurately.
